# Primer Design

Primers were designed to target exon 2 of the human KRAS gene using Primer3.

## Strategy
Initial attempts using exon-only sequence failed due to insufficient template length. Intronic flanking regions were incorporated to enable stable primer binding and generate an amplicon compatible with paired-end NGS.
