Target Gene: KRAS
Transcript ID: ENST00000256078
Target Region: Exon 2 (with intronic flanking regions)

Forward Primer:
Sequence: GATACACGTCTGCAGTCAACT
Length: 21 bp
Tm: 58.05°C
GC Content: 47.62%

Reverse Primer:
Sequence: TCAGTCATTTTCAGCAGGCCT
Length: 21 bp
Tm: 59.93°C
GC Content: 47.62%

Expected Amplicon Size: ~512 bp

Primer Design Tool: Primer3 (https://primer3.ut.ee/)
Design Strategy:
- Exon-only sequence was initially tested but failed to generate stable primer pairs.
- Intronic flanking regions were added to provide adequate template length.
- Parameters were selected to reflect typical NGS amplicon requirements.
